\description{
This function creates a YAML file with the placeholder text to define a new
rule. The file is stored in \code{flir/rules/custom}. You need to create the
\code{flir} folder with \code{setup_flir()} if it doesn't exist.

If you want to create a rule that users of your package will be able to
access, use \code{export_new_rule()} instead.
