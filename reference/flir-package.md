# flir: Find and Fix Lints in R Code

Lints are code patterns that are not optimal because they are
inefficient, forget corner cases, or are less readable. 'flir' provides
a small set of functions to detect those lints and automatically fix
them. It builds on 'astgrepr', which itself uses the 'Rust' crate
'ast-grep' to parse and navigate R code.
